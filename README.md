# BoxFinder


This is Jeff the car.

The goal is to control a toy RC car via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins by abusing the switches on the controller that came with the car.

This actually works! Sort of. The engines work, and they move according to my directions.


TODO:

- Send camera input to a server

- Find out why the object isn't detected even though it is when I run this on my laptop

- Implement proportional control and periodic moving

- Fix distance detection
